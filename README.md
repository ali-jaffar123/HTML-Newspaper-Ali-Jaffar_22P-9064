## Project Description

This project recreates a pre-1990 Urdu newspaper front page using only HTML5. 
The layout is based on a historical newspaper reporting the tragic plane crash of President Zia-ul-Haq in 1988. The design mimics a traditional three-column newspaper structure using semantic HTML tags and table-based layout techniques.
